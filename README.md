# Binary Complement Generator

This program is designed to generate the one's complement of a binary number input by the user.

## Usage

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, you can use `g++` on Unix-like systems:

    ```bash
    g++ binary_complement_generator.cpp -o binary_complement_generator
    ```

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./binary_complement_generator
    ```

3. **Input**: Enter a binary number when prompted. The program will check if it's a valid binary number and then generate its one's complement.

4. **Output**: The program will display the input binary number followed by its one's complement.

## Program Details

The program consists of the following files:

- `binary_complement_generator.cpp`: Contains the C++ code for the Binary Complement Generator.

## Functionality

- `read()`: Reads a binary number input by the user.
- `check()`: Checks if the input binary number is valid (contains only '0' and '1').
- `convert()`: Generates the one's complement of the input binary number.
- `Display()`: Displays the input binary number and its one's complement.
